## Install and run locally

### Backend

```bash
$ cd api/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Explore the API using GraphiQL at [http://localhost:3100/graphiql](http://localhost:3100/graphiql). 

### Frontend

```bash
$ cd ui/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The structure of the frontend code is inspired by an [article written by Alexis Mangin](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1). It'll allow us to keep the project structured and consitent as the codebase grows.
